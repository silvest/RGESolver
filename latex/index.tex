 A {\ttfamily C++} library to perform renormalization group evolution of SMEFT coefficients numerically. A faster, approximate solution that neglects the scale dependence of the anomalous dimension matrix is also available. The general flavour case at dimension-\/six level is considered. Operators that violate lepton and/or baryon number conservation are not considered. ~\newline
 The documentation for this library can be found \href{https://silvest.github.io/RGESolver/annotated.html}{\texttt{ here}}. ~\newline

 If you use {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} please cite \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06838}{\texttt{ https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/2210.\+06838}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily GSL} \+: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a {\ttfamily C} library for numerical computations. More details can be found in the \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily GSL} website}}.
\item {\ttfamily BOOST} \+: {\ttfamily BOOST} is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}} requires only the {\ttfamily BOOST} headers, not the full libraries, thus a header-\/only installation is sufficient. More details can be found in the \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily BOOST} website}}.
\item {\ttfamily C++11} \+: A compiler that supports at least {\ttfamily C++11} standard is required. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The installation of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} requires the availability of {\ttfamily CMake} in the system (version {\ttfamily 3.\+1} or greater). A description of {\ttfamily CMake} and the instructions for its installation can be found in the \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily CMake}website}}. Clone the repository with 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git\ clone\ https://github.com/silvest/RGESolver\ -\/-\/recursive}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The installation can be performed writhing the following lines in a terminal session (in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} directory)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir\ build\ \&\&\ cd\ build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ ..\ <options>}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ -\/-\/build\ .}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ -\/-\/install\ .}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Note that depending on the setting of installation prefix (see below) the user might need root privileges to be able to install {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} (thus {\ttfamily cmake -\/-\/install .}should be replaced with {\ttfamily sudo cmake -\/-\/install .})\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Command line options for the installation}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/DLOCAL\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+:BOOL=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}ON or OFF\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} \+: to install {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} in the directory {\ttfamily build/install} (default\+: {\ttfamily OFF}).
\item {\ttfamily -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\+:PATH=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}} installation directory\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} \+: the directory in which {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} will be installed (default\+: {\ttfamily /usr/local}). This variable cannot be modified when {\ttfamily -\/DLOCAL INSTALL ALL=ON} is set.
\item {\ttfamily -\/DDEBUG\+\_\+\+MODE\+:BOOL=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}ON or OFF\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} \+: to enable the debug mode (default\+: {\ttfamily OFF}).
\item {\ttfamily -\/DBOOST\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+DIR\+:PATH=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}include path\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/boost/} \+: {\ttfamily CMake}checks for {\ttfamily BOOST} headers availability in the system and fails if they are not installed. Thus, if {\ttfamily BOOST} is not installed in the predefined search path, the user can specify where it is with this option. The path must end with the {\ttfamily boost/}directory which contains the headers.
\item {\ttfamily -\/DGSL\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DIR\+:PATH=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}gsl-\/config directory\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} \+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}} uses {\ttfamily gsl-\/config} to get the {\ttfamily GSL} parameters. If this is not in the predefined search path, the user can specify it with this option.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
The {\ttfamily rgesolver-\/config} script is available in the {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/bin} directory (default\+: {\ttfamily /usr/local}), which can be invoked with the following options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/cflags}\+: to obtain the include path needed for compilation against {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}}.
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/libs}\+: to obtain the flags needed for linking against {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the path {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/bin} is not in the predefined search path, the compilation will (most likely) fail. if the user wants to use the compilation command above, it is suggested to add {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/bin} to the {\ttfamily \$PATH} variable. Alternatively, the script can be invoked from a terminal session in {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/bin} to visualize the paths to the library and to the headers.

After the installation, the example program {\ttfamily Example\+Evolution.\+cpp} (available in the {\ttfamily Examples} directory) can be compiled with the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{g++\ -\/o\ app\ ExampleEvolution.cpp\ `rgesolver-\/config\ -\/-\/cflags`\ `rgesolver-\/config\ -\/-\/libs`}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Uninstall}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
The user can uninstall the library typing in a terminal session in the {\ttfamily build} directory\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake\ -\/-\/build\ .\ -\/-\/target\ uninstall}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Also in this case, depending on the setting of installation prefix, the user might need root privileges to be able to uninstall {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_r_g_e_solver}{RGESolver}}}.
